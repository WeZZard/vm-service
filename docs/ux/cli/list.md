# Machine list and acquisition

## CL-1: The machine list

- `machctl list` discovers the instances ([FD-2](../../arch/federation.md#fd-2-discovery)) and prints one table of every machine and every virtual machine offer ([FD-3](../../arch/federation.md#fd-3-aggregation)).
- Rows are grouped by instance, with the local instance first. Inside an instance the durable machine comes first, when the instance exposes one, then the running virtual machines, then the offers.
- An instance with durable exposure off has no durable row. 192.168.50.3 is such an instance today (DC-39).
- An unreachable instance keeps one row, which names the error, and in Consul mode its Consul health status.
- `--json` prints the merged list as JSON: one object per instance with its `instance`, `address`, `reachable`, `error` and `machines`, where each machine is the record of [MM-3](../../arch/machines.md#mm-3-capability-report).
- `--local` lists only the local instance. `--kind durable` or `--kind virtual` filters by kind. `--require <capability>` filters by capability, as CL-2 describes.
- `--instance <ID or address>` lists one instance. An address that discovery does not find is asked directly.
- The JSON objects also carry `local`, `found_by` (`local`, `bonjour`, `consul` or `address`), `consul` (the instance's Consul health, in Consul mode) and `catalog` (its image catalog status) (DC-63, DC-84).
- A reachable instance with no machine shows one row with the state `none`, so that it is never missing from the list. While a filter is active, an instance with no matching machine is left out, and an unreachable instance is kept.
- `machctl list` exits 0 when any instance answered, and 2 with the hint to start the service when none did.

```

- When an instance does not answer, its machines are replaced by one row:

```text
mac-mini-m4-2    -                               -        unreachable  connection refused (Consul: critical)
```

- The `GPU` column prints `metal3` when the machine supports Metal 3, and otherwise its families.
- The `CI` column prints `busy` or `idle` for a Mac with a CI runner and `-` for one without.
- A warning, such as `low free disk` or a missing permission, is printed under its row, indented.
- When an instance's image catalog is `stale` or `unavailable` ([IC-5](../../arch/image-catalog.md#ic-5-a-failed-rebuild)), a warning line above that instance's rows names the failing file and the time of the failure.

## CL-2: Acquire by capability

- `machctl acquire --purpose <slug> --require metal3 --require unreal` asks for any machine that has every listed capability.
- The capabilities a client can require are names over the capability report: `metal3`, `durable`, `virtual`, `unity`, `unreal`, `xcode`, `cua-driver`, `claude-code`, `codex`, `screen-recording` and `ci-idle`.
- A requirement over a fact the report does not know never matches. `claude-code` and `codex` need the program and, where the record reports agent keys, a present key and gateway endpoint. `ci-idle` matches a Mac without a CI runner or with an idle one (DC-63).
- The CLI lists the machines, keeps those that match, and prefers in order: an available durable machine whose CI runner is idle, then any available durable machine, then a virtual machine offer that is acquirable. It acquires from the instance that owns the first candidate and tries the next candidate when that acquisition is refused for capacity.
- `--machine <name>` acquires a named durable machine, and `--image <image>` acquires a virtual machine, as `vmctl acquire` did. `--instance <ID>` chooses the instance for an image, and narrows the instances `--require` chooses among. Without any of the three forms the image is `macos26`.
- The forms exclude one another. The flags that shape only a virtual machine (`--network`, `--profile`, `--cpu`, `--memory-mb`, `--disk-gb`, `--no-wait`, `--vnc`, `--source`, `--expected-source-fingerprint`) are refused with `--machine` and `--require`, because a durable machine refuses them (DC-69).
- The CLI prints the machine it chose and why on standard error, before each attempt, so a person can see the choice and standard output stays the lease's JSON: `chose mac-mini-m4-2 (durable, metal3, CI idle)`. An offer adds `offer on <instance>`.
- A capacity refusal is `durable machine leased`, `durable machine unavailable` ([MM-5](../../arch/machines.md#mm-5-states)) or `macOS VM limit reached`. Any other refusal ends the command with its error. When every candidate is refused for capacity, the command exits 1 naming each refusal (DC-69).

## CL-3: Naming a machine

- `exec`, `push`, `pull`, `heartbeat`, `release` and `status` take a machine name. A durable machine's name is unique. A virtual machine may be written `<vm>@<instance>`, and the CLI requires that form when two instances have a machine of that name.
- The CLI finds the owning instance from the merged list and remembers the `lease_id` of the leases it acquired in `~/.local/state/machine-service/cli-leases.json` (or under `$MACHINE_SERVICE_STATE`), so a person does not type it. `exec`, `push`, `pull`, `heartbeat` and `release` send it; `--lease-id` overrides it. The file maps each lease to its machine and the owning instance's address, is mode 600, is changed under an exclusive lock and replaced by a rename, and a release forgets its lease (DC-72).
- `push` and `pull` to a remote instance send the bytes ([FD-4](../../arch/federation.md#fd-4-working-on-a-remote-instance)). The command line is the same as for a local instance, and `--bytes` sends the bytes to a local one too (DC-78).
- `wait` finds its machine the same way. A name that no instance lists goes to the local instance, whose answer says it is unknown. Two instances listing the name is refused with the `<vm>@<instance>` form in the error (DC-64).
- The console commands stay with the local instance, because their viewer runs on the service host. A selected environment keeps every command on its own instance and refuses `<vm>@<instance>` and `--instance` (DC-64).
