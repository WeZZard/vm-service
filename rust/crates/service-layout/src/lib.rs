//! The executables a machine-service installation places beside the daemon
//! (`docs/arch/installation.md` IN-1, DC-79).
//!
//! The daemon finds its helpers next to its own executable: the console
//! worker it spawns, and the guest agents and the DNS-over-TLS forwarder it
//! uploads into a guest. The installer copies the same executables into the
//! install folder. Both read this one list, so an executable the daemon looks
//! up is an executable the installer requires and installs; a helper added to
//! the daemon without an entry here has no way to be resolved.
//!
//! This crate is a leaf: `console` must not depend on `machine-service-core`,
//! and both resolve through it.
