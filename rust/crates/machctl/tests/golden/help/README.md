# `machctl --help` golden corpus

Byte-for-byte reference output from the Python implementation this crate
replaced. The Rust `machctl` renders `--help` through an `argparse` formatter
port (`src/argparse_help.rs`), and `tests/help_golden.rs` compares its output
against these files at widths 20, 24, 25, 30, 33, 40, 80, 120, 160, 240 and
300. The narrow widths cross the minimum help position `argparse` will use, and
the wide widths go past the point where wrapping stops changing.

Each directory is a `COLUMNS` value. `top.txt` is the top-level parser; every
other file is the same-named subcommand. The corpus covers the top level and
all 18 subcommands (19 invocations) at each width.

## Provenance

Generated from `bin/vmctl` at commit `193e0f6`, extracted to `/tmp/py-vmctl`,
with CPython 3.14.7. The exact generation command run from `/tmp/py-vmctl`,
writing into this directory:

```sh
commands=(environment acquire wait list images images-show status exec push pull \
  heartbeat release capabilities acquisition-capabilities console-resolve \
  console-open console-cancel gc)
for w in 20 24 25 30 33 40 80 120 160 240 300; do
  COLUMNS=$w python3 vmctl --help > "<corpus>/$w/top.txt"
  for c in "${commands[@]}"; do
    COLUMNS=$w python3 vmctl "$c" --help > "<corpus>/$w/$c.txt"
  done
done
```

To regenerate at an arbitrary width, for example 80:

```sh
cd /tmp/py-vmctl
COLUMNS=80 python3 vmctl --help
COLUMNS=80 python3 vmctl acquire --help
```

All captures are non-tty (`stdout` redirected to a file), so no ANSI escapes
are present.

## Changes after the Python implementation

- `acquire.txt` at every width was regenerated from the Rust `vmctl` when
  `--network` gained the `internet` choice (DC-13), because the Python
  implementation no longer exists. Each file differs from its Python capture
  only in the `{nat,internet,control-only}` choice list and the usage line it
  rewraps.
- Every file at every width was regenerated from the Rust `machctl` when the
  CLI was renamed from `vmctl` to `machctl` and its description began to name
  machine-service (DC-35). The program name sets the usage line's indentation,
  so the narrow widths rewrap. The renderer that produced them is the one the
  Python captures above verified byte for byte, and only the program name and
  the description changed.
